## 1. Introduction to Machine Learning

Machine Learning is a revolutionizing technology and it has the potential to transmute the future. It enables computers to make data-driven decisions without explicit human interactions. As we know, Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that allows computers to learn from data or make decisions or predictions based on that learning. Unlike traditional programming approaches, where a programmer must explicitly define rules for a task, ML systems automatically learn from the data, identify patterns, and make decisions without being explicitly programmed for specific tasks.

Machine Learning systems usually take place where rule-based programming or traditional programming approaches are too complex or impractical to implement. Such as Image recognition, text recognition, and self-driving cars.

**Formal Definition of Machine Learning**

In technical terms, machine learning refers to the development of algorithms that enable a machine to improve its performance based on past experiences. These experiences are usually presented in the form of data, and the machine learns by analyzing this data to identify trends and patterns.


## 2. How Machine Learning Works

At its core, machine learning relies on various algorithms and data. The process typically starts by creating a model and then we provide data to our model and then the model starts training with the given data, the training will only be successful, if our data is reliable and sufficient to train the model. There are various techniques to judge whether the data is reliable or not, and accuracy is one of those metrics. So, after the training, we check the accuracy of the model, and if everything is as expected then we say the model is dependable. Now, whenever, we pass the fresh input to the model, it will predict or make decisions based on the previous training.

**What happens when the accuracy is not as expected**

In this case, where the accuracy is not as expected, it means that the model is an underfit model (where the accuracy is very low) or an overfit model (where the accuracy is very high). In both scenarios, the model will be retrained. 

**You might wonder that if we use the same data for retraining, how can we expect a different result? Let's deep dive into this question.**

This is a great question and the answer lies in the training process. How we structure the training process, and how we modify the different aspects of the training to improve the model's performance. If we simply retrain the model using the same approach and the same dataset, the results are likely to be similar. To resolve the issue we have several techniques:

- **Changing the model architecture:** We can modify the model architecture and algorithms. For example, if we are using `classification supervised machine learning` and the dataset is not suitable for this algorithm then we can switch to some other machine learning algorithms like `clustering unsupervised machine learning` or some other suitable machine learning algorithms. It can help us to improve the model's accuracy and performance.
- **Hyperparameter tuning:** It is critical aspect of 
- **Data splitting**
